<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tahiya Nuzhath Khan. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at the Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology (MJIIT), UTM KL. I’m passionate about technology, especially in the field of web development and software solutions. I enjoy learning new programming languages and building projects that solve real-world problems.  
</p>

<p>Alongside my academic journey, I’ve also been involved in volunteering activities and university events. I recently worked as a Buddy for the Glocal Eminence Course (GEC) 2025, where I supported Japanese students in cultural exchange, academic tasks, and project work. This experience helped me improve my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills.

<p>I consider myself a hardworking and motivated individual who is always eager to grow and face new challenges. I enjoy working in teams, sharing knowledge, and learning from others.  

In my free time, I love exploring new technologies, watching tech tutorials, and sometimes just relaxing with music. I believe in continuous learning and always strive to be better than I was yesterday.
